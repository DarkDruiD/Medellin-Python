# Medellín Python and Django Meetup

This repo contains the files of my exposition at the Medellín Python and Django meetup, I talked about IoT and how to address the challenges it comes with, also talked about a set of tools that can improve the performance of IoT applications, MQTT and Google Protocol Buffers play a major roll in this.

# Repo Structure

There are two git repos embedded in this major repo, one contains the MQTT examples and is under the folder labeled as MQTT, and the other one that is named Protobuffs contains a set of benchmarks comparing JSON and the Google Protocol Buffers, the Slides are inside the folder with the correspondent name.
